## Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

This is one of my first **HTML/CSS/JS** projects. Click [here](https://kbousquet.github.io/rock-paper-scissors) for the **Live version** of the game.
### First stage | Game in the browser console
**The benefits I got from this stage:**
* Deepened understanding of functions and how they can call one another.
* Learned how to clear the console between each game.
* Enjoyed stylizing the console logs for readability.

### Second stage | Game with added UI
**The benefits I got from this stage:**
* Deepened understanding of eventListeners.
* Learned how to use fonts from the web using Google Fonts.
